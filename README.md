# TodoList App with JavaScript Vanilla and Vite.js

This is a TodoList application developed using JavaScript Vanilla and Vite.js. In this application, we will learn about various concepts, including scopes, local variables, global store, modules, localStorage, sessionStorage, deployments, function documentation, DOM manipulation, and maintaining global application state.

## Concepts Learned

### Scopes and Local Variables

In JavaScript, scopes determine the accessibility of variables. Local variables are declared using `let` or `const` within a function or block, and they are only accessible within that context. In this application, we will use local variables to manage UI elements and interact with the DOM.

### Global Store and Modules

We will implement a global store to maintain the application's state in a single place. This will allow us to access and modify data consistently across different parts of the application. We'll learn how to export and import modules in JavaScript to organize our code in a modular fashion and maintain clarity.

### LocalStorage and SessionStorage

We'll use `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` to store data in the browser. This will enable us to persist the todo list data even after the user closes the browser. We'll learn how to save and retrieve data using these local storage mechanisms.

### DOM Manipulation

DOM manipulation is crucial for updating the user interface based on the application's state. We'll learn how to add, remove, and modify elements in the DOM using JavaScript. This will include creating new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

### Function Documentation

A good practice in software development is to document functions clearly to understand their purpose and usage. We'll learn how to write descriptive comments for our functions and methods, which will facilitate collaboration and long-term code maintenance.

### Maintaining Global State

Maintaining a consistent global state is crucial for a smooth application experience. We'll learn how to manage and update the global state of the application effectively, ensuring that all parts of the user interface reflect the current state of the tasks.

### Deployments

We will explore how to deploy our application in a production environment so that users can access and use the application online. We'll learn about different options and considerations when deploying the application.
